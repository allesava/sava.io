            <h2 class="title">1. An overview of data protection</h2>
            <strong>General information</strong>
            <p>The following information will provide you with an easy to navigate overview of what will happen with your personal data when you visit our website. The term “personal data” comprises all data that can be used to personally identify you. For
                detailed information about the subject matter of data protection, please consult our Data Protection Declaration, which we have included beneath this copy.</p>

            <strong>Data recording on our website</strong>
            <p>Who is the responsible party for the recording of data on this website (i.e. the “controller”)? The data on this website is processed by the operator of the website, whose contact information is available under section “Information Required by
                Law” on this website.</p>

            <strong>How do we record your data?</strong>
            <p>We collect your data as a result of your sharing of your data with us. This may, for instance be information you enter into our contact form.</p>
            <p>Our servers automatically record other data when you visit our website. This data comprises primarily technical information (e.g. web browser, operating system or time the site was accessed). This information is recorded automatically when you
                access our website.</p>

            <strong>What are the purposes we use your data for?</strong>
            <p>A part of the information is generated to guarantee the error free provision of the website. Other data may be used to analyse your user patterns.</p>

            <strong>What rights do you have as far as your information is concerned?</strong>
            <p>You have the right to receive information about the source, recipients and purposes of your archived personal data at any time without having to pay a fee for such disclosures. You also have the right to demand that your data are rectified,
                 blocked or eradicated. Please do not hesitate to contact us at any time under the address disclosed in section “Information Required by Law” on this website if you have questions about this or any other data protection related issues. You
                also have the right to log a complaint with the competent supervising agency.</p>
            <p>Moreover, under certain circumstances, you have the right to demand the restriction of the processing of your personal data. For details, please consult the Data Protection Declaration under section “Right to Restriction of Data Processing.”</p>

            <strong>Analysis tools and tools provided by third parties</strong>
            <p>There is a possibility that your browsing patterns will be statistically analysed when your visit our website. Such analyses are performed primarily with cookies and with what we refer to as analysis programmes. As a rule, the analyses of your
                   browsing patterns are conducted anonymously; i.e. the browsing patterns cannot be traced back to you. You have the option to object to such analyses or you can prevent their performance by not using certain tools. For detailed information about this, please consult our Data Protection Declaration below.</p>
            <p>You do have the option to object to such analyses. We will brief you on the objection options in this Data Protection Declaration.</p>

            <h2 class="title">2. General information and mandatory information</h2>
            <strong>Data protection</strong>
            <p>The operators of this website and its pages take the protection of your personal data very seriously. Hence, we handle your personal data as confidential information and in compliance with the statutory data protection regulations and this Data
                 Protection Declaration.</p>
            <p>Whenever you use this website, a variety of personal information will be collected. Personal data comprises data that can be used to personally identify you. This Data Protection Declaration explains which data we collect as well as the
                      purposes we use this data for. It also explains how, and for which purpose the information is collected.</p>
            <p>We herewith advise you that the transmission of data via the Internet (i.e. through e-mail communications) may be prone to security gaps. It is not possible to completely protect data against third party access.</p>
            <p>Information about the responsible party (referred to as the “controller” in the GDPR).</p>
            <p>The data processing controller on this website is:</p>
            <p>Stefan Wütrich<br/>
                Email: <a href="mailto:stefan@altafino.com">stefan@altafino.com</a></p>
            <p>The controller is the natural person or legal entity that single-handedly or jointly with others makes decisions as to the purposes of and resources for the processing of personal data (e.g. names, e-mail addresses, etc.).</p>

            <strong>Revocation of your consent to the processing of data</strong>
            <p>A wide range of data processing transactions are possible only subject to your express consent. You can also revoke at any time any consent you have already given us. To do so, all you are required to do is sent us an informal notification via
               e-mail. This shall be without prejudice to the lawfulness of any data collection that occurred prior to your revocation.</p>

            <strong>Right to object to the collection of data in special cases; right to object to direct advertising (Art. 21 GDPR)</strong>
            <p>In the event that data are processed on the basis of Art. 6 Sect. 1 lit. e or f GDPR, you have the right to at any time object to the processing of your personal data based on grounds arising from your unique situation. This also applies to any
                profiling based on these provisions. To determine the legal basis, on which any processing of data is based, please consult this Data Protection Declaration. If you log an objection, we will no longer process your affected personal data, unless we are in a position to present compelling protection worthy grounds for the processing of your data, that outweigh your interests, rights and freedoms or if the purpose of the processing is the claiming, exercising or defence of legal entitlements (objection pursuant to Art. 21 Sect. 1 GDPR).</p>
            <p>If your personal data is being processed in order to engage in direct advertising, you have the right to at any time object to the processing of your affected personal data for the purposes of such advertising. This also applies to profiling to
                the extent that it is affiliated with such direct advertising. If you object, your personal data will subsequently no longer be used for direct advertising purposes (objection pursuant to Art. 21 Sect. 2 GDPR).</p>

            <strong>Right to log a complaint with the competent supervisory agency</strong>
            <p>In the event of violations of the GDPR, data subjects are entitled to log a complaint with a supervisory agency, in particular in the member state where they usually maintain their domicile, place of work or at the place where the alleged
                violation occurred. The right to log a complaint is in effect regardless of any other administrative or court proceedings available as legal recourse.</p>

            <strong>SSL and/or TLS encryption</strong>
            <p>For security reasons and to protect the transmission of confidential content, such as purchase orders or inquiries you submit to us as the website operator, this website uses either an SSL or a TLS encryption programme. You can recognise an
                 encrypted connection by checking whether the address line of the browser switches from “http://” to “https://” and also by the appearance of the lock icon in the browser line.</p>
            <p>If the SSL or TLS encryption is activated, data you transmit to us cannot be read by third parties.</p>

            <h2 class="title">3. Recording of data on our website</h2>
            <strong>Cookies</strong>
            <p>In some instances, our website and its pages use so-called cookies. Cookies do not cause any damage to your computer and do not contain viruses. The purpose of cookies is to make our website more user friendly, effective and more secure.
                Cookies are small text files that are placed on your computer and stored by your browser.</p>
            <p>Most of the cookies we use are so-called “session cookies.” They are automatically deleted after your leave our site. Other cookies will remain archived on your device until you delete them. These cookies enable us to recognise your browser the
                  next time you visit our website.</p>
            <p>You can adjust the settings of your browser to make sure that you are notified every time cookies are placed and to enable you to accept cookies only in specific cases or to exclude the acceptance of cookies for specific situations or in
                 general and to activate the automatic deletion of cookies when you close your browser. If you deactivate cookies, the functions of this website may be limited.</p>
            <p>Cookies that are required for the performance of the electronic communications transaction or to provide certain functions you want to use (e.g. the shopping cart function), are stored on the basis of Art. 6 Sect. 1 lit. f GDPR. The website
                     operator has a legitimate interest in storing cookies to ensure the technically error free and optimised provision of the operator’s services. If other cookies (e.g. cookies for the analysis of your browsing patterns) should be stored, they are addressed separately in this Data Protection Declaration.</p>

            <strong>Server log files</strong>
            <p>The provider of this website and its pages automatically collects and stores information in so-called server log files, which your browser communicates to us automatically. The information comprises:</p>

                <li>The used operating system</li>
                <li>Referrer URL</li>
                <li>The hostname of the accessing computer</li>
                <li>The time of the server inquiry</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This data is not merged with other data sources. This data is recorded on the basis of Art. 6 Sect. 1 lit. f GDPR. The operator of the website has a legitimate interest in the technically error free depiction and the optimization of the
                operator’s website. In order to achieve this, server log files must be recorded.</p>

            <strong>Contact form</strong>
            <p>If you contact us via our contact form, the information provided in the contact form as well as any contact information provided therein will be stored by us in order to handle your inquiry and in the event that we have further questions. We
                 will not share this information without your consent.</p>
            <p></p>Hence, the processing of the data entered into the contact form occurs exclusively based on your consent (Art. 6 Sect. 1 lit. a GDPR). You have the right to revoke at any time any consent you have already given us. To do so, all you are
            required to do is sent us an informal notification via e-mail. This shall be without prejudice to the lawfulness of any data collection that occurred prior to your revocation.</p>
            <p>The information you have entered into the contact form shall remain with us until you ask us to eradicate the data, revoke your consent to the archiving of data or if the purpose for which the information is being archived no longer exists (e.g
                 . after we have concluded our response to your inquiry). This shall be without prejudice to any mandatory legal provisions – in particular retention periods.</p>

            <h2 class="title">4. Analysis tools</h2>
